# Travel-App
This my last project from Udacity Front-End Web Developer Course. This project requires minimumly to build out a travel app to obtains a desired trip destination & date from the user, and displays weather and an image of the destination using information obtained from external APIs.

Following the course instructions, I developed this travel app to pull data from APIs and displays the destination, how many days away for departure, weather forcast for multiple days(within 16 days from today) and photos for destination with user's input of **Destination** and **Departure Date**. User can add multiple trips, remove individule trip or remove all trips in one click.
